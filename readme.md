Introduction to Bitcoin Mining:

1. Bitcoin is nothing but a ledger. 
2. A ledger is a set of transactions, which are stored in different blocks also called as Block Chain.
3. Each block has its own block number, transactions ledger, previous hash(hash of previous block) and nonce. 
4. Mining is the process of guessing a nonce that generates hash with first "x" number of zeros.
5. Bitcoin mining is Time consuming, and it takes a lot of computational power and hardware.
6. But the code is not difficult algorithmic wise.
7. And whoever guesses a nonce first will be benefited not the later persons. 
8. Currently the difficulty level of mining is around 20 zeros in the prefix of hash.
